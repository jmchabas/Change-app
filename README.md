# Change app

A simple starter project. You're in **Cursor** — here’s how to use it.

---

## Cursor in 3 steps

### 1. **Chat (what you’re doing now)**  
- Use the **Chat** panel (right side or bottom) to talk to the AI.  
- You can say things like: “Add a dark mode” or “Explain this file” or “Fix this error.”  
- The AI can read your project, edit files, and run commands for you.

### 2. **Ask the AI to do things**  
- Be specific: “Create a login page” or “Add a button that saves the note.”  
- You can @-mention files: e.g. “In `index.html`, change the title to My App.”  
- The AI will apply changes and, when useful, run commands (e.g. start a server).

### 3. **Run your app**  
- For this project: open `index.html` in your browser, or run a local server (see below).  
- When you want to run something, you can say: “Run the app” or “Start the dev server.”

## How to run this project

**Option A – Open the file**  
- In Finder, double-click `index.html`, or  
- In Cursor: right-click `index.html` → “Reveal in Finder” → double-click the file.

**Option B – From the terminal (in Cursor)**  
- Open the terminal: **View → Terminal** or `` Ctrl+` `` (Mac: `` Cmd+` ``).  
- Run:  
  `npx --yes serve .`  
- Then open: **http://localhost:3000**

## What to do next

Tell the AI in Chat what you want, for example:

- “Add a form to log changes”
- “Make it look like a real app with a sidebar”
- “Turn this into a React app”
- “Add dark mode”

The AI will edit the code and guide you. You don’t need to approve every step unless you want to.
